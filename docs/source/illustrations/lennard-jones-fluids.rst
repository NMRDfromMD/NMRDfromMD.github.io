Lennard-Jones fluid
===================

Here, NMR relaxation rates are measured from a Lennard-Jones fluid, and compared
to the results from Ref. :cite:`grivetNMRRelaxationParameters2005`.

MD system
---------

The system consists of 16,000 particles interacting via the classical 
Lennard-Jones (LJ) 12-6 potential and simulated using
LAMMPS :cite:`thompsonLAMMPSFlexibleSimulation2022`.
Each particle has a mass 
:math:`m = 1\,\text{g/mol}`, and LJ parameters 
:math:`\sigma = 3\,\text{Ã…}` and :math:`\epsilon = 0.1\,\text{kcal/mol}`.
All reduced parameters were taken to match the study by Grivet 
:cite:`grivetNMRRelaxationParameters2005`.
A cutoff of :math:`4 \sigma` was used for the LJ interactions. The 
simulation box has a volume of :math:`(26.9~\sigma)^3`, chosen to match 
the reduced density of :math:`\rho^* = 0.84`.
Production runs were performed in the microcanonical (NVE) ensemble, 
during which 10,000 timesteps were executed, equivalent to 50 times 
the reference time :math:`\sqrt{m \sigma^2/\epsilon}`. Configurations 
were recorded every 10 timesteps. A timestep of 
:math:`0.005\,\sqrt{m \sigma^2/\epsilon}` was used.
The imposed temperatures ranged from :math:`T = 30` to 
:math:`160\,\text{K}`, corresponding to reduced temperatures from 
:math:`T^* = 0.8` to :math:`3.0`.

All LAMMPS input scripts and analysis scripts written in Python are provided
on GitHub; see |dataset-LJ-fluid|.

Results
-------

The correlation function :math:`G^{(0)}` was first extracted for two temperatures, :math:`T = 50`
and :math:`140\,\text{K}`, and compared with the correlation functions reported by Grivet :cite:`grivetNMRRelaxationParameters2005`.
Our results show an excellent agreement with the results from Grivet, thus validating the
NMR formalism used here as well as the LJ system and parameters.

    for two different temperatures, and compared with the data from Grivet :cite:`grivetNMRRelaxationParameters2005` (open symbols).

The NMR relaxation rates :math:`R_1`
and :math:`R_2` was also extracted for all the temperatures, at
a frequency :math:`f_0 = 150\,\text{GHz}`. Our results
show a good agreement with the data from Grivet :cite:`grivetNMRRelaxationParameters2005`.
